========

Mish-mash of heavily customised [dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki#) w/ an [etherpad](http://etherpad.org) running for each new wiki article.

Commissioned by [Workshop Project](http://www.workshopproject.org) for [FREE, A DESIGN EDUCATORS WORKSHOP](https://workshopproject.wiki). Design by [Anja Groten](http://anjagroten.com).

* [Etherpad Lite](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite) + [php client](https://github.com/tomnomnom/etherpad-lite-client)

note: 

Dokuwiki seems to be too much dependant on a specific dev stack (jQuery, old version of LESS), which makes it less fun to deeply customise. Next time go for a more bare-bone wiki (cfr [pmwiki](http://www.pmwiki.org) or [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info)).
